# YouTubeâ„¢ Rating Loader

This is a chrome extension to display bars showing the like/dislike ratio to video thumbnails on YouTube.

# Motivation

This extension is meant as a replacement for the existing chrome extension whose reviews suggest that they have been injecting tracking links on websites besides YouTube.

I have no idea whether such claims are true, but I did not feel comfortable using the extension so long as it requests permissions on all pages and is not releasing its source.

So I have made this extension is available under the GPLv3 and it requests permissions only on youtube. I have no idea how this extension compares feature-wise as I have not installed the extension in question.
